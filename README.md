## The Problem
- Create a method that converts decimal (base 10) numbers into their Roman Numeral equivalent
- Only allow conversions from 1 to 3999 inclusive

## Approach
- Researched roman numerals on Wikipedia using the [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) provided in the tech test email 
- Decided to follow subtractive notation as this form appears to be very common snd is the one I am personally most familier with

## Assumptions

## Caveats

## Running the code
- Install NodeJS from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This will also install NPM.
- From a command prompt at the root folder of the project
    - Run `npm install`
    - Run `npm run convert`

## Running the tests
- From a command prompt at the root folder of the project
    - Run `npm test`
